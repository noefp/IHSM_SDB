	RNA-Seq of atemoya (<i>Annona squamosa</i> × <i>A. cherimola</i>) (cv. African Pride) pericarp fruits during post-harvest storage with and without ethylene treatment.
</p>

<h4>Experimental Conditions:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Normal treated fruits.</li>
	<li>Ethylene treated fruits.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The samples were obtained from the "Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences" in Guangdong, China. Twenty fruits were kept at room temperature with no treatment, and the following four stages were selected for transcriptome sequencing: recently picked fruits (NT-0), cracking at the pedicel (NT-PC-1), moderate cracking at the pedicel (NT-PC-2), and severe cracking at the pedicel (NT-PC-3). Another twenty fruits were immersed in 2 g/kg ethylene for 2 min, transferred into a closed plastic box, and the lid was left open after 24 hours. The following three stages were selected for transcriptome sequencing: fruits 24 hours after ethylene treatment (Eth-24), fruits with pericarp cracking after ethylene treatment (Eth-PC), and no fruit cracking after ethylene treatment (Eth-NC).
<br>
Three similar pericarp samples under the same treatment at each stage were collected, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at −80 °C until use. Each sample of RNA was prepared by mixing three replicate samples.
