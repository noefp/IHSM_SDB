<p>
	RNA-Seq of atemoya (<i>Annona squamosa</i> × <i>A. cherimola</i>) pulp of split and non-split fruits.
</p>

<h4>Experimental Conditions:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Split fruits.</li>
	<li>Non-split fruits.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	The samples were obtained from the "Lingnan Normal University" in Guangdong, China. All fruits were harvested at 6 months after pollination. Non-split fruits (NSF) and split fruits (SF) were selected at 10 days after harvest. All of the fruit samples were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 ºC until use. Each sample of RNA was prepared by mixing three replicate samples.
