  Our group's activity revolves around the sustainable utilization of genetic resources in subtropical fruit trees, considering both current conditions and future climate change projections. This initiative stands as a unique endeavor within the CSIC. We collect detailed knowledge of plant materials, advanced cultivation techniques, and the utilization of genomic tools to pursue the following specific objectives:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Study, conservation, and utilization of plant genetic resources.</li>
  <li>Exploration of reproductive biology implications in fruit setting.</li>
  <li>Development of innovative cultural technologies to enhance productivity and quality.</li>
  <li>Selection of plant materials for incorporation into improvement programs via classical and biotechnological methods.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Our commitment lies in exploring the intricate dynamics between genetics, agriculture, and environmental sustainability. By integrating cutting-edge genomic approaches with traditional agricultural practices, we strive to pave the way towards a more resilient and fruitful future for subtropical fruit cultivation.
